# PyPlant app

PyPlant is a Python-based application that enables you to create a smart plant pot system. 
It leverages sensor data to provide valuable insights and recommendations for optimal plant growth. 
By monitoring key environmental factors, PyPlant helps you maintain an ideal environment for your plants, 
ensuring their health and vitality.

All sensor data is virtual. This was created as final project in my python class. It is not meant to be used
